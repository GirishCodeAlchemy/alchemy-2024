1. Run the First program Hello world

   `swift helloworld.swift`

Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:

- Variables are always initialized before use.
- Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.
- Integers are checked for overflow.
- Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.
- Memory is managed automatically.
- Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.
